            <span><b>Mitra</b></span> is a website that serves as a platform for food donation, shelter homes, and
            hospitality. The website
            is designed to connect people who want to donate food or provide shelter to those in need with individuals
            or organizations that require these services.

            Through Mitra, users can easily donate excess food or unopened packaged food items to those who are hungry
            or in need of sustenance. The website also connects individuals or organizations that provide shelter homes
            for the homeless or those who need temporary housing due to various reasons such as displacement, domestic
            violence, or natural disasters.

            Additionally, Mitra also serves as a platform for hospitality, where users can offer to host guests who are
            in need of temporary accommodation or are traveling for medical treatments or other reasons.

            The website is easy to navigate and allows users to search for specific types of donations or services in
            their local areas.

            Overall, Mitra is a valuable resource for those in need of food, shelter, or hospitality, and for those who
            want to help by making a difference in their communities.

        <p class="para-graph">So this site is made for those peoples who were in <b>Emergency</b> and want help but
            don't have any knowledge about that location. </p><br>

        <p class="para-graph"> This site has three sections:
        <ul class="un-ordered">
            <li>FOOD DONORS</li>
            <li>SHELTER</li>
            <li>HOSPITALS</li>
        </ul>
        </p><br>

        <h2>FOOD DONOR</h2>
        <p class="para-graph">Our main objective for choosing this theme, is to help those poor peoples who were dying
            from
            hunger on daily basis.
            We know that there were many NGO’s ,working for those poor peoples.
            But lack of communication between the peoples who have excess of food and the NGO’s is the main issue,<br>
            A piece of bread can also save someone's life.

        </p> <br>

        <h2>SHELTER</h2>
        <p class="para-graph">This section provides the data of oldage homes near the entered location.

        </p><br>
        <h2>HOSPITALS</h2>
        <p class="para-graph"> This section provides the location and contacts of nearby hospitals.
            Such that the peoples who were in emegency can easily reach the nearby hospital.
